# Books CRUD - Express + TypeScript
In this project I created a Books API using Express + TypeScript + JSON, a CRUD (Creat, Read, Update, Delete) was implemented.

## To run:
1. Clone the repository
  * `git clone git@github.com:thiagopcdev/MyArrayFilter-Typescript.git`
2. Enter the repository folder you just cloned:
  * `cd myFilter`
3. Install the dependencies:
  * `npm install`
4. Run the program:
  * `npm start`
